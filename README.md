# Pang AI

**Pang AI** is an AI extension for PenguinMod. It provides all the blocks you need for your AI projects, designed to be accessible for everyone.

I am excited to help people learn how to use AI components at an early age. You can use this however you like, with no prompt limits.

**Not only chatbots** you can also use it for random idea generators, name generators, and more. It’s not just my ideas; it’s your creativity being put to use!
